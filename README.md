## üìñ Algorithm Details

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- **Strategy**: Level-by-level exploration
- **Guarantees**: Shortest path
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Best for**: Unweighted graphs
- **Race performance**: Consistent, reliable

### DFS (Depth-First Search)
- **Strategy**: Depth-first exploration
- **Guarantees**: Finds *a* path
- **Time**: O(V + E)
- **Best for**: Memory-constrained scenarios
- **Race performance**: Fast but not optimal

### A* (A-Star)
- **Strategy**: Heuristic-guided search
- **Guarantees**: Optimal with admissible heuristic
- **Time**: O(b^d)
- **Best for**: Large search spaces
- **Race performance**: Usually wins!

### Dijkstra
- **Strategy**: Priority queue exploration
- **Guarantees**: Optimal path
- **Time**: O((V+E) log V)
- **Best for**: Weighted graphs
- **Race performance**: Very reliable

### Quantum Parallel
- **Strategy**: Multiple simultaneous paths
- **Guarantees**: Explores many options
- **Time**: Variable
- **Best for**: Demonstrating parallelism
- **Race performance**: Unique approach

### Bidirectional BFS
- **Strategy**: Search from both ends
- **Guarantees**: Shortest path
- **Time**: O(b^(d/2))
- **Best for**: Known start and end
- **Race performance**: Often fastest

## üìä Statistics Explained

### Path Length
Number of moves in solution
- Lower = shorter path
- Optimal for BFS, A*, Dijkstra

### Nodes Explored
Total squares examined
- Lower = more efficient
- Higher = more thorough

### Execution Time
Algorithm runtime in milliseconds
- Varies by complexity
- Useful for race comparison

### Efficiency
`(Path Length / Nodes Explored) √ó 100%`
- Higher = more direct
- 100% = perfect (impossible)
